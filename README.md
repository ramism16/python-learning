# python-learning-basics
This repository contains all the python files I created as I introduced myself to the world of Computer Science and programming using Python. These include the tasks I gave myself for self-understanding and some that I received from friends and instructors. 

From conditional statements to recursion and file handling, I educated myself gradually with small application-based tasks and you can too! 

The code is mostly self-explanatory. Most of the files even have a main() that you can use for basic console I/O.
